# Pyber Analysis
## Overview
An analysis was conducted on PyBer ridesharing data breaking down total rides given, total number of drivers, total fares collected, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for different types of cities in order to assist the PyBer company in decision making.
## Results
For reference, the summary statistics table is shown below.

## Summary
Looking at the data, there is a stark difference in the average fare per ride and average fare per driver based on city type. Rides are more expensive in less densely populated areas, possibly reflecting the fact that car trips cover less distance in more densely populated areas. This results in the PyBer service being more expensive in areas where per capita income is lower. To adress these issues, I reccomend the following:
* Raise the per mile price in urban cities. This will help raise the fares collected per ride in the areas where population is densest and the most rides are given, which will have a large effect on profits.
* Be much less agressive in hiring drivers, especially in urban areas. Rural cities have the highest number of rides given per driver at 1.6 (125/78). That's less than 2 rides per driver. The situation is most dire in urban cities, with each active driver averaging less than 1 ride given. It's clear that there were more than enough PyBer drivers to cover the demand in 2019, and a substantial reduction in the number of drivers could help keep costs down and result in each individual driver earning more money and being more satisfied with their work for PyBer.
* Lower the per mile price in rural cities. Only 125 rides were given in rural cities in 2019, which is appproximately 1 ride every 3 days. Rural areas of the country tend to have the lowest per capita income, and PyBer rides are at their most expensive in those cities. Perhaps there would be more demand if the price were lower.
